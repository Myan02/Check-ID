CHECK ID GUI APPLICATION

A simple GUI application that checks IDs. The program will either allow entry a correct ID is selected, or deny the user.
To quit the program, simply write "Close Window" and enter. Can you figure out what the formula for proper IDs is?

    Given a string, the integers within must sum up to 100. 
    If two integers are adjacent, they are counted as a double digit value
    E.G.
      AB3C53EFG13HIJ9KL20MN2 -> 3+53+13+9+20+2=100 which is valid!

This project was created for a little game I made, incorporating the game Among Us to be played live in a group setting. 
The ID checker was one of the tasks the players had, and given unique IDs, they had to fill in the information to pass the task.

For any questions or concerns please reach out!
